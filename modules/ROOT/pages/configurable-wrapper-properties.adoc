The following list provides the configurable wrapper properties for Mule 3 that you can include in your `$MULE_HOME/conf/wrapper.conf` file:

[cols=3*,options=header]
|===
|Property |Description | Default Value
|`anypoint.platform.client_id` | Client id to be validated against `anypoint.platform.coreservice_base_uri`. This property can be encrypted when using the `anypoint.platform.encryption_key` property, for example `![rOgginfvFur5bs8RNhTPrg==]` |
|`anypoint.platform.client_secret` | Secret to be validated against `anypoint.platform.coreservice_base_uri`. This property can be encrypted when using the `anypoint.platform.encryption_key` property, for example `![qxsvR6rarv/gJdH11mWVgA==]` |
|`anypoint.platform.enable_api_gateway` | Flag that enables gateway entitled modules in the case that the client id or client secret were not defined | false
|`anypoint.platform.platform_base_uri` | Represents the URL to which the agent should report its status, for example `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform+` |
|`anypoint.platform.coreservice_base_uri` | Represents the URL to which the agent should report its status, for example `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts+` |
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri` | Represents the url where the gateway should post analytics status and metrics, for example `+https://analytics-ingest.anypoint.mulesoft.com+` |
|`anypoint.platform.proxy_host` | The host of the proxy through which communications with the Anypoint Platform goes out, for example `+http://myorg.proxy.net+` |
|`anypoint.platform.proxy_port` | The port of the proxy through which communications with the Anypoint Platform goes out, for example `8080` |
|`anypoint.platform.proxy_username` | The username used to authenticate against the proxy, for example `myproxyuser` |
|`anypoint.platform.proxy_password` | The password used to authenticate against the proxy, for example `myproxypass`. This property can be encrypted when using the `anypoint.platform.encryption_key` property, for example `![PVJYfVINSF8IzRKsNwmxMg==]` |
|`anypoint.platform.poll_policies_freq` | Interval between each poll for new policies from API platform. Time is expressed in seconds. | 60 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.api_keep_alive_freq` | Interval between each keep alive notification to API platform. Time is expressed in seconds. | 15 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.retry_failed_apis_freq` | Interval between reattempts to track untracked API's. Time is expressed in seconds | 15 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.gatekeeper` | Blocks traffic to tracked APIs until all policies retrieved from platform are applied successfully.

* `strict` (default, also known as true) +
APIs blocked till platform policies are applied +
* `flexible` +
Same as `strict` but in case of downtime tries to use local backup if available +
* `disabled` (also known as false) +
APIs are never blocked |
|`anypoint.platform.on_prem` | Used to configure if the gateway instance should run in `on_prem` mode. Setting this flag on turns:

* `anypoint.platform.platform_base_uri` +

* `anypoint.platform.coreservice_base_uri` +
To mandatory fields since in `on_prem` mode you should run these solutions inside your organization. Default is false |
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_enabled` | This flag enables or disables analytics statistics. If this property is enabled and `anypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri` is not an URL then `analyticsQueue` and `analyticsProlicyViolationsQueue` are exposed through Mule registry in the properties `_analyticsQueue` and `_analyticsPolicyViolationQueue` | true
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_push_freq` | Time elapsed between each push to analytics. Time is expressed in seconds.| 5 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_cache_capacity` | Cache capacity of the analytics events stored in the internal mapDB used for analytics.| 50000
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_cache_file` | The name of the analytics report file.| `api-platform-analytics.db`
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_policy_violations_file` | The name of the analytics policy violations report file.| `api-platform-analytics-policy-violations`
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_policy_violations_cache_capacity` | Cache capacity of the analytics policy violations events stored in the internal mapDB used for analytics.| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_policy_violations_push_freq` | Time elapsed between each push to analytics reporting policy violations. Time is expressed in seconds.| 5 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_policy_violations_threshold` | Upper bound to policy violations. If the same policy (policyId) is violated more than the amount of times between each push to analytics, then the message is discarded and logged.| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.analytics_batch_size` | Upper bound amount of messages to be sent to analytics at once. Each pushes the gateway instance at most this value.| 500000
|`throttling.persistence_enabled` | This flag enables or disables persistence of the throttling quota.| true
|`throttling.persistent_data_update_freq` | Time elapsed between each dump of the throttling quota state to disk. Time is expressed in seconds.| 15 seconds
|`anypoint.platform.x_forwarded_headers_propagation` | Allows generation of X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Host headers.| true
|`anypoint.platform.ping_federate_cache_max_size` | Upper bound amount of tokens cached for the ping federate policy.| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.openid_connect_cache_max_size` | Upper bound amount of tokens cached for the openId policy.| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.open_am_cache_max_size` | Upper bound amount of tokens cached for the open AM policy.| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.oauth2_cache_max_size` | Upper bound amount of tokens cached for the OAuth 2 policy. From 3.8.7/3.9.2 onwards (in previous versions, `-oauth2Cache`).| 100000
|`anypoint.platform.proxy_filter_mule_headers` | When using auto-generated proxies, this option enables or disables the filtering headers that start with `mule_` before sending them to the endpoint behind it.| true
|`anypoint.platform.encryption_key` | The key used the decrypt the encrypted properties, possible encrypted properties are `anypoint.platform.client_id`, `anypoint.platform.client_secret` and `anypoint.platform.proxy_password`. To encrypt the values use the xref:4.1@mule-runtime::secure-configuration-properties.adoc[Secure Properties Tool].|
