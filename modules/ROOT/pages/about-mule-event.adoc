= Mule Events

A Mule event contains the core information processed by the runtime. It travels through components inside your Mule app following the configured application logic.

Note that the Mule event is immutable, so every change to an instance of a Mule event results in the creation of a new instance.

A Mule event is composed of these objects:

* A Mule Message contains a message payload and its associated attributes.
* Variables are Mule event metadata that you use in your flow.

A Message source, such as the Scheduler, HTTP Listener, or On New or Updated File component, triggers the generation of a Mule event and dispatches that event to the flow.

. A trigger reaches the event source.
. The event source produces a Mule event.
. The Mule event travels sequentially through the components of a flow.
. Each component interacts in a pre-defined manner with the Mule event.

== Event Creation Issues

In some cases, a Message source does not produce a Mule event or a Mule error object. For example, setting a path that _does not_ exist in an On New or Updated component prevents the creation of a Mule event in that flow. When the initial attempt to access that path from the Mule application fails, the application logs an ERROR message, such as `ERROR 2020-11-24 ... Failed to connect/reconnect ... Path '/Users/me/***\*&^--\' doesn't exist. ... IllegalPathException` (shortened for readability). However, the component does not create or dispatch a Mule event to the flow, so there is no corresponding error object, and it is not possible to use the predefined `error` variable in a DataWeave expression to select fields in an associated object. 

In addition, _invalid_ requests to an HTTP Listener log INFO about the issue but do not produce an ERROR message or an Mule error object. For example, if the *Path* of the HTTP Listener component is `/a\b`, which is invalid, the Mule application logs a set of INFO messages similar to the following ones (shortened for readability):

[source,txt,linenums]
----
INFO  2020-11-24 ... DefaultRequestMatcherRegistry: No listener found for request: (GET)/a/b
INFO  2020-11-24 ... DefaultRequestMatcherRegistry: Available listeners are: [([*])/a\b
----

Logging such errors as INFO rather than as an ERROR helps avoid distributed denial of service (DDOS) security vulnerabilities.
