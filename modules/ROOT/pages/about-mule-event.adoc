= Mule Events

A Mule event contains the core information processed by the runtime. It travels through components inside your Mule app following the configured application logic.

Note that the Mule event is immutable, so every change to an instance of a Mule event results in the creation of a new instance.

A Mule Event is composed of these objects:

* A Mule Message contains a message payload and its associated attributes.
* Variables are Mule event metadata that you use in your flow.

A Message source, such as the Scheduler, HTTP Listener, or On New or Updated File component, generates and dispatches a Mule event to the flow.

. A trigger reaches the event source.
. The event source produces a Mule event.
. The Mule event travels sequentially through the components of a flow.
. Each component interacts in a pre-defined manner with the Mule event.

== Event Creation Issues

In some cases, a Message source does not produce a Mule event. For example, setting a path that does not exist through the On New or Updated component prevents the creation of the event. The initial attempt to access that path from the Mule application generates an ERROR message, such as `ERROR 2020-11-24 ... Failed to connect/reconnect ... Path '/Users/me/***\*&^--\' doesn't exist. ... IllegalPathException` (shortened for readability). However, it does not generate an error object because the the Message source does not trigger the creation of a Mule event. 

In addition, an _invalid_ requests to the HTTP Listener logs INFO about the issue but does not produce an ERROR message or an Mule error object. For example, if the *Path* of the HTTP Listener component is `/a\b`, which is invalid, the Mule application logs an INFO notification similar to the following one (shortened for readability):

[source,txt,linenums]
----
INFO  2020-11-24 ... DefaultRequestMatcherRegistry: No listener found for request: (GET)/a/b
INFO  2020-11-24 ... DefaultRequestMatcherRegistry: Available listeners are: [([*])/a\b
