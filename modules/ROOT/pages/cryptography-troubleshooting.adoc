= Troubleshoot Cryptography Module

To troubleshoot Cryptography module, become familiar with the information about app logs, PGP protocol, attached and detached signature, and interpreting commonly thrown messages.

== View the App Log

If you encounter problems while running your Mule runtime engine (Mule) app, check the app log as follows:

* If you’re running the app from Anypoint Platform, the output is visible in the Anypoint Studio console window.
* If you’re running the app using Mule from the command line, the app log is visible in your OS console.

Unless the log file path is customized in the app’s log file `log4j2.xml`, view the app log in the default location `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`.

== Enable Cryptography Module Debug Logging

To begin troubleshooting Cryptography Module, enable debug logging to see the exact error messages:

. Access Anypoint Studio and navigate to the *Package Explorer* view.
. Open your application’s project name.
. Open the `src/main/resources` path folder.
. Open the `log4j2.xml` file inside the folder.
. Add the following line:
+
`<AsyncLogger name=”com.mulesoft.modules.cryptography" level="DEBUG" />`

[start=6]
. Save your changes.
. Click the project name in *Package Explorer* and then click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*.

== Troubleshoot PGP Encryption and Decryption

During PGP encryption, the sender of the message must encrypt its content using the receiver’s _public key_. So, whenever you want to encrypt messages in your Mule app using someone else’s public key, in the *Crypto Pgp* global configuration add the _receiver_ public keyring file in the *Public keyring* field.

During PGP decryption, the receiver of the message must use its _private key_ to decrypt the contents of a message that was encrypted using a public key. To decrypt the message, in the *Crypto Pgp* global configuration add the _receiver_ private keyring file in the *Private keyring* field.

== Troubleshoot PGP Signature

In addition to encrypting, you can sign a message, the signature provides an integrity check of the original message.

To create a signature, in the *Crypto Pgp* global configuration add the _sender_ private keyring file in the *Private keyring* field.
To validate a signature, in the *Crypto Pgp* global configuration add the _sender_ public keyring file in the *Public keyring* field.

=== PGP Signature Types and Operations

Cryptography module has two PGP signature operations:

*Pgp sign* +
Creates a PGP armored signature in ASCII format. The signing is done with the private key of the sender, so the secret passphrase must be provided.
*Pgp sign binary* +
Creates a PGP binary signature. The signing is done with the private key of the sender, so the secret passphrase must be provided.

There are two types of signatures:

* Attached signature +
Given a signed document, you can either check the signature or check the signature and recover the original document.

* Detached signature +
The signature and the document are created separately.

Currently, Cryptography module supports only validation of detached signatures.

== Understand Common Throws

Here is a list of common throw messages and how to interpret them.

* CRYPTO:PARAMETERS

 Invalid parameters were given to the operation.

* CRYPTO:MISSING_KEY

 A key required for the operation was not found.

* CRYPTO:PASSPHRASE

 Invalid unlocking password provided.

* CRYPTO:CHECKSUM

 An error occurred during an attempt to calculate a checksum.

* CRYPTO:TRANSFORMATION

 An error occurred during an attempt to transform binary to armored.

* CRYPTO:VALIDATION

 The signature could not be validated against the data.
