The DataWeave examples show how to convert a file stream into Base64 and to convert a Base64 string into a file stream. They use a PDF file as the input and output.

== Encode a PDF File to Base64

You can simulate the transformation in the Read operation from the <<xml_config, XML configuration>>. This example performs Base64 encoding on a PDF file. More specifically, it converts a Base64 file stream (`application/octet-stream`) to Binary and outputs the Binary in the `text/plain` format.

The example uses the following functions:

*  `readUrl` from the `Core (dw::Core)` module to input a PDF file.
+
The example assumes that the PDF file is in the `src/main/resources` directory of a Mule project in Anypoint Studio. It provides the name of the PDF file and specifies the MIME type as `application/octet-stream`.
* `fromBase64` from the `dw::core::Binaries` module to transform a Base64 string to a binary value.

//NOTE that we can't yet automate this example. Outputs text format.
//Need to check if PDF input is supported by validator.

== Decode Base64

You can simulate the transformation in the Write operation from the <<xml_config, XML configuration>>. This DataWeave example converts a Base64 file stream (`application/octet-stream`) to Binary and outputs the Binary in the `text/plain` format. It does not generate a PDF file; a Write operation is required to generate such a file.

The examples use the following functions from the `dw::core::Binaries` module:

*  `readUrl` to input a PDF file.
+
The example assumes that the PDF file is in the `src/main/resources` directory of a Mule project in Anypoint Studio. It provides the name of the PDF file and specifies the MIME type as `application/octet-stream`.
* `fromBase64` in the `dw::core::Binaries` module to transform a Base64 string to a binary value.

The script reads the input PDF as an octet-stream MIME type. From within the call to `fromBase64`, the script coerces that input to a string value before coercing the string to Base64.

//NOTE that we can't yet automate this example. Outputs text format.
//Need to check if PDF input is supported by validator.

== XML Configuration Example

The configuration XML in the following procedure is a Mule flow that encodes and decodes a PDF file. It reads the file from the specified local directory using the Read operation from the File module. It writes the PDF to the specified directory.

You can create this example in Anypoint Studio:

. Create a Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Use *Add Module* in the Mule Palette to add the File module.
. Copy and paste the following example between the `<mule/>` elements of a Mule flow in Anypoint Studio.

. Place a PDF file of your choice into a local directory on your machine.
. Correct the input and output directories of the Read and Write operations:
+
* In the Read operation, change the *File Path* value `/Users/me/Downloads" to the location of your PDF file.
* In the Write operation, change the *Path* value `/Users/me/pdf-test.pdf"` to the location and file name that you want to output the file.
. Run the project in Studio.
. Load the `0.0.0.0:8081/transform` into a browser.
+
This action creates a PDF file in the specified location and generates a separate `transform` file with the message in the Set Payload component, `PDF file created in the directory specified in the Write operation.`
