MuleSoft provides Javadocs for the Mule Kernel (formerly the called the Mule Community Edition).

The Javadocs contain definitions for classes, fields and their data types, and it also describes methods, including their usage, parameters, and return values.

Read the Mule SDK documentation if you want an easier way to extend the Mule runtime engine to meet your needs. You can find links to the Javadocs below:
